# TypeScript base pack

This folder contains a very minimal, lightweight hello world application that can be built, tested, packaged, and run with npm tool.

## Prerequisites

Clone this repository from git. You do not need to fork it or send your code anywhere, just clone the code for the live coding exercise.

You should have npm installed. The most important thing is that your installation is set up so you can compile, test, and run TypeScript code.

You probably want to have an IDE installed, any of them will work, but if you want a suggestion, we would recommend VS Code. If you already love Atom, Emacs, Vi, or have written your own IDE, by all means bring that along.

## Am I ready for the interview?

You are ready for interview, when you can run these operation, either from a command line or from your favourite IDE:

```sh
npm install
npm test
npm start
```

Done with all that! Congratulations! Now we can start coding immediately with your working environment. If you want to prepare for the interview, brush up on your basic TypeScript and unit test skills a bit, then come with a relaxed attitude. Purpose is not to do any challenging coding, purpose is just to chat by some code, to get to know each others as coders. It's like fireside chat - just with less fire and more TypeScript hopefully!
